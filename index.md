## Professional Interests
My real interest lies where AI, ML, and data science come together. I enjoy taking concepts and turning them into practical tools that solve actual problems. I'm especially drawn to the progress in NLP and the potential within LLMs for tasks like building better conversational systems. Creating models is key, but I'm also keen on the whole lifecycle – making sure ML systems are robust, deployable, and well-managed, which touches on MLOps. Finding valuable insights hidden in data and building effective, trustworthy AI solutions is what truly drives my work.
